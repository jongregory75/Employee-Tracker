# MySQL: Employee Tracker

## Motivation

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this application, my goal was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

run 'node empTracker.js' from the terminal window

You'll be greeted with prompts to then view, add, update, or delete various parts of the employee database.

## Database Schema

![Database Schema](/Images/schema.JPG)

Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

:heavy_check_mark: Add departments, roles, employees

:heavy_check_mark: View departments, roles, employees

:heavy_check_mark: Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

:heavy_check_mark: Delete departments, roles, and employees

```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
